### What is CI/CD?
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated stages that transform your code into a running website.

#### a. Continuous Integration (CI)

- Code changes are automatically pulled from your Git repository. 

- Unit tests, code quality checks, and integration tests are run. 

- If successful, the code is built into a deployable artifact. 

#### b. Continuous Delivery (CD)

- The artifact is deployed to a staging environment for manual testing and approval. 

- Upon approval, the artifact is deployed to the production environment. 

- Performance and health checks are continuously run.
